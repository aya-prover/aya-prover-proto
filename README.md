You need Java SE 16 to set this project up. This also means if your choice of IDE is IntelliJ IDEA, you need version
2021.1 or higher. If you have problems downloading dependencies (like you are in China), check out [how to][proxy] let
gradle use proxies.

```bash
# build Aya and its language server as an application which
# can be used on a Java-free environment to lsp/build/image
./gradlew jlink
# build a platform-dependent installer for Aya and its language
# server with the jlink artifact to lsp/build/jpackage
# Requires https://wixtoolset.org/releases on Windows
./gradlew jpackage
# run tests and generate coverage report to build/reports
./gradlew mergeJacocoReports
# do both
./gradlew githubActions
```

+ Ask [@ice1000] to get access to the development repository.
  + Do not create pull requests directly. Ask before doing anything.
+ Questions opened as issues will be answered.
+ Aya is under active development. Nothing guaranteed, but we can share something here:
  + Dependent types, including pi-types, sigma types, etc. You could write a [type-safe interpreter][gadt].
  + Overlapping patterns. Very [useful][oop] in theorem proving.
  + Arend-ish interval type which is used to define the HoTT [path type][path].
